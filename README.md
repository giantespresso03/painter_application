# Painter Application

### Used Framework: QT
### Used Language: C++

### Project Description:
In Applications Programming class, I was assigned to create a simple drawing application which closely resembles the Microsoft Paint application. However, we were supposed to design the application in a way that a 6 year old can use it with ease. Therefore, I tried my best to not use any word in my application and convey the funtionalities in the application purely through the pixel art images that I have created. 

Here are the different functionalities of my application and the description of it:
-**Pen functionality:** By utilizing ***ChangeColor()*** and ***ChangePendWidth()*** functions, I was able to let the user control and change the color and the size of the virtual pen, which user can left click and drag in order to draw on white canvas
-**Eraser functionality:** It was built the same exact way as the pen functionality, except it's default color is locked to white, so that it can "erase" the drawings on white canvas
-**Emoji stamp functionality:** By utilizing the ***ChangeEmoji()*** function, the users can change what kinds of text-based emojis that they wish to use on their painting by clicking on the right mouse button
